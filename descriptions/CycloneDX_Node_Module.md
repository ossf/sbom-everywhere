The GitHub repository "CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-module" is designed to create CycloneDX SBOM from node-based projects. It operates under the Apache 2.0 license, indicating its open-source nature. The repository serves as a meta-package, grouping tools aimed at generating CycloneDX SBOMs for various node ecosystems like npm, with others like yarn and pnpm yet to be announced. It is important to use the specific tools suited to your ecosystem rather than relying on this meta-package itself.
