# **OSSF SBOM Everywhere SIG**

- TODO: Add Description

##
**Motivation**

- The initial motivation for the formation of the OSSF SBOM Everywhere SIG is born from OpenSSF's [The Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan](mobilization_plan.pdf).  SBOM standardization and consensus from within the open source community is integral to adoption of universal constructs that reveal themselves via the exploration of use cases beyond a compliance check box.  [Executive Order ]

##
**Objective**

**Draft**
### The 3 overarching goals from the White House meeting
- Securing OSS Production: focus on preventing security defects and
  vulnerabilities in code and open source packages in the first place
- Improving Vulnerability Discovery & Remediation: improving the process
  for finding defects and fixing them
- Shorten Ecosystem Patching Response Time: Shorten the response time for
  distributing and implementing fixes.

### The goals for this group as defined in the mobilization plan
- The requirements needed to build use cases using SBOMs are clearly
  understood, documented and implemented in current SBOM specifications
- There are “friction free” open source tools that generate SBOMs that meet
  these requirements
- There is readily accessible education, awareness and implementation
  guidance and 3rd party support


##
**Scope**

**Draft**
The mobilization plan defines scope as
_By focusing on tools and advocacy, we can remove the barriers to
generation, consumption, and overall adoption of SBOMs everywhere, we can
improve the security posture of the entire open source ecosystem:
producers, consumers, and maintainers._

This group's interpretation is
- [Use cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15X0TspuxUg19YScqNK1tl5kYpJV2xOrcuSx6CwanYZ0/edit#)
- Defining types of SBOMs
  - Source
  - Binary analysis
  - Build
  - Deploy Runtime
- Generation
  - Formats - clearly define expectations
- Consumption
  - How do we track and encourage the consumption of the artifacts
  - something about tools
- Adoption (how do we encourage others to create and use SBOMs)
  - Something about producers, consumers, and maintainers
  - Where does the burden lie on accountability and enforcement?
  - something about tools
    - Tools are everywhere, what do we do with this?
  - something about advocacy
- Attestation?
  - Not part of tooling, this needs to be a policy decision in these
    conversations, don't worry about the technical details (yet)
  - Where does this fit in? Producers, consumers, ???
