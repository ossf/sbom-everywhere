The [SPDX Online Tools repository](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools) provides a website for handling Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) documents. The tools allow users to upload, validate, compare, and convert SPDX documents, as well as search the SPDX license list. The project is built with Python and Django, supporting deployment via Docker. It requires specific dependencies like Python 3.7+ and Redis for certain features. The repository also includes instructions for running the tools locally and using the associated APIs.
