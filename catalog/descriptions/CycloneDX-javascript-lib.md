The CycloneDX JavaScript Library is a TypeScript implementation of the
CycloneDX tool for Node.js and web browsers. Its main responsibilities include
providing general-purpose functionality, typing, data models, normalizers, and
serialization for CycloneDX in JavaScript environments. The library supports all
shipped data models, respects custom specifications, generates reproducible output,
and provides formal JSON and XML validators according to the CycloneDX Specification
(currently for Node.js only).

Enhanced capabilities of this library include enums for various use cases such
as attachment encoding, component scope, component type, external reference type,
hash algorithm, vulnerability status, analysis justification, analysis response,
analysis state, and rating. This extensive support makes it an ideal choice for
managing Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in JavaScript
