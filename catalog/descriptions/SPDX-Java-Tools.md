The GitHub repository [SPDX/tools-java](https://github.com/spdx/tools-java) hosts command-line tools for working with SPDX documents using the Spdx-Java-Library. These tools support converting SPDX documents between various formats (e.g., RDF/XML, JSON, YAML), comparing multiple SPDX files, validating SPDX documents, and generating SPDX verification codes. The repository supports multiple versions of the SPDX specification and provides detailed examples for developers. It also includes instructions for contributing, building, and using the tools. The tools are available on Maven Central and for download as binaries.
