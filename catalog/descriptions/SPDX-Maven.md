The [SPDX Maven Plugin](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-maven-plugin) is a tool designed to generate Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) documents for Maven artifacts. It integrates with the Maven build process to produce SPDX files based on the information specified in the POM file. The plugin supports various configurations, including file-level metadata, license declarations, and more. It is useful for automating the creation of SPDX documents, ensuring that licensing and package details are accurately captured during the build process.
