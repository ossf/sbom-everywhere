The [CycloneDX Ruby Gem](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-ruby-gem) is a tool that generates a CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Ruby projects. It can be installed via RubyGems or built from source. The gem provides options for specifying project paths, output formats, and verbosity. The generated SBOM can be output as either an XML or JSON file, facilitating easy integration into various development workflows. CycloneDX is a lightweight SBOM specification, ensuring compatibility and ease of use across projects.
