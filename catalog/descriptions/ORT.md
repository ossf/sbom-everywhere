The [OSS Review Toolkit (ORT)](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort) is a toolset designed to automate software compliance checks, focusing on managing open-source software dependencies. It supports generating SBOMs (CycloneDX, SPDX), automating FOSS policy enforcement, and evaluating security advisories, among other features. ORT is highly customizable and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines or used as a standalone library or command-line tool. It's actively maintained and is part of the Linux Foundation's ACT project.
