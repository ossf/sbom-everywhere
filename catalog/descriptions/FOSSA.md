[FOSSA](https://fossa.com) is a software composition analysis tool with a mature SBOM management product offering. The SBOM management tool enables users to produce and ingest SBOMs in either SPDX or CycloneDX, monitor SBOMs for vulnerabilities and license compliance issues, and securely share SBOMs with customers. FOSSA also offers extensive remediation support to help organizations prioritize vulnerabilities they may uncover associated with the components in their SBOM.
