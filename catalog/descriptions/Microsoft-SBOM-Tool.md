The **[Microsoft SBOM Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool)** is an advanced, scalable solution designed to generate SBOMs compatible with SPDX 2.2 for various types of artifacts. This tool leverages Component Detection libraries for identifying components and the ClearlyDefined API to populate license information for these components.

### Key Features and Capabilities:
1. **Scalability and Enterprise-Readiness**: It's designed to handle the demands of enterprise environments, ensuring robustness and scalability in SBOM generation.
2. **Support for Multiple Platforms**: The tool offers executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS, providing flexibility across different operating systems.
3. **SBOM API NuGet Package**: Users can integrate the SBOM tool with their projects via the `Microsoft.Sbom.Api` NuGet package, with detailed API documentation available for reference.
4. **SBOM Generation Process**: Users can generate SBOMs by specifying parameters like drop path, build components path, package name, version, supplier, and namespace URI base. The tool ensures all relevant files are hashed and included in the SBOM, and supports a unique namespace for each SBOM.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: The tool can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines using guides for GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipelines, enhancing automation and continuous integration capabilities.
7. **Contribution Opportunities**: Open to contributions and suggestions, the project requires adherence to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and follows the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct.
