**[Anchore Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)** is a powerful vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems, offering a range of features and functionalities:

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Grype can scan container images and filesystems to find known vulnerabilities. It supports major operating system packages like Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, and also scans for vulnerabilities in language-specific packages such as Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Python, Dotnet, Golang, PHP, and Rust. Additionally, it supports Docker, OCI, and Singularity image formats.

2. **Installation**: Grype can be installed via a simple command-line instruction, and is available through Homebrew and MacPorts for macOS users. It is compatible with macOS and Linux operating systems.

3. **Usage**: To get started with Grype, users need to install the binary and ensure it is available in their path. Scanning for vulnerabilities is as straightforward as executing `grype <image>`. It also supports scanning all layers of an image for comprehensive vulnerability detection.

4. **Supported Sources**: Beyond Docker, Grype can scan container image archives, Singularity Image Format (SIF) containers, and directories. It provides flexibility in specifying sources with schemes for different daemons and formats.

5. **Vulnerability Data Structure**: Grype provides detailed vulnerability information including ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, related vulnerabilities, match details, and artifact information.

6. **Output Formats**: The tool offers several output formats including a columnar summary (default), CycloneDX XML and JSON reports, and a customizable template format for user-specified output.

7. **Gating on Severity**: Grype can be configured to exit with an error if vulnerabilities of a specified severity level or higher are found. This feature is particularly useful in script or CI pipeline integrations.
