The SPDX Gradle Plugin on GitHub is designed to generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in SPDX format for Gradle projects. The plugin allows you to specify SBOM targets, configure document properties, and integrate SCM information. It also supports custom configurations and output files, making it adaptable for various project needs. The plugin is available on the Gradle Plugin Portal and can be locally developed and deployed. Note that some features are experimental and subject to change.
