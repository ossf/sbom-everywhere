## Overview of CycloneDX PHP Composer

CycloneDX PHP Composer is a tool that generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) documents specifically for PHP projects using Composer, the dependency manager for PHP. This tool adheres to the CycloneDX SBOM standard, which is widely used for ensuring that all components, dependencies, and metadata related to a software project are accurately documented and easily shareable.

### Key Features

1. **Composer Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Composer, making it easy to generate an SBOM for any PHP project without altering the existing workflow.
   
2. **CycloneDX Specification**: Outputs SBOMs in the CycloneDX format, which is a standard for software supply chain component analysis. This ensures compatibility with a wide range of security and compliance tools.

3. **Dependency Tracking**: Captures a detailed list of all direct and transitive dependencies of a PHP project, including versioning and licensing information, which is crucial for vulnerability management and compliance.

4. **JSON and XML Formats**: Supports both JSON and XML formats for SBOM generation, providing flexibility in how the SBOM is consumed or integrated into other tools.

5. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The tool can be easily used via a command-line interface, allowing for automation and integration into CI/CD pipelines.
