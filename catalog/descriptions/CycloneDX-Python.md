You can explore the CycloneDX Python tool directly on its GitHub page [here](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python).

### Key Features

- **Dependency Analysis**: The tool scans Python projects to detect dependencies, including transitive dependencies, ensuring that all components used in the project are accurately represented.

- **Multiple Output Formats**: CycloneDX Python supports generating SBOMs in both XML and JSON formats, which are compatible with CycloneDX standards.

- **Integration with Python Tools**: It integrates seamlessly with common Python packaging tools such as `pip`, `pipenv`, and `poetry`, allowing for the easy generation of SBOMs directly from these environments.

- **Licensing and Vulnerability Data**: The tool can incorporate licensing information and vulnerabilities, providing a more comprehensive view of the potential risks associated with the software components.

- **Continuous Integration Support**: CycloneDX Python can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated generation of SBOMs as part of the build process, which is essential for maintaining up-to-date documentation of software dependencies and ensuring compliance with security standards.
