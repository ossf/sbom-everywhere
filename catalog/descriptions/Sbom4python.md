SBOM4Python is an open-source tool designed to generate a SBOM for installed Python modules. It supports various formats, including SPDX and CycloneDX, and identifies both explicit and hidden dependencies of Python modules. The tool can be integrated into continuous integration systems for maintaining accurate SBOM records and supporting audit processes. It offers features like excluding or including license detection, generating dependency graphs, and providing output in different formats (Tag, JSON, YAML). Licensed under Apache 2.0, SBOM4Python is useful for software development and security audit functions, with limitations in validating the completeness of SBOM data. The tool's repository is available on GitHub: [SBOM4Python](https://github.com/anthonyharrison/sbom4python).
