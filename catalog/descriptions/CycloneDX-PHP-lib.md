The CycloneDX PHP Library is a tool designed to work with OWASP CycloneDX
documents, which is a Bill of Materials (BOM) standard for cyber risk reduction
in the software supply chain. This PHP implementation provides a general-purpose
solution for handling CycloneDX, supporting PHPDoc3 and Psalm annotations, data
models, JSON and XML normalization, serialization, validation, and composer-based
autoloading for downstream usage.


Key features include enums for various use cases such as ComponentType, ExternalReferenceType,
HashAlgorithm, and LicenseAcknowledgement. Additionally, it provides data models
for Bom, BomRef, Component, ExternalReference, HashDictionary, LicenseExpression,
Metadata, Property, Tool, and more.
