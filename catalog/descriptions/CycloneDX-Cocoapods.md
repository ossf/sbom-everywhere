The CycloneDX CocoaPods tool is a Ruby Gem that generates a CycloneDX SBOM for Objective-C and Swift projects using CocoaPods. This tool helps create a lightweight and easily parseable BoM document outlining project dependencies. It supports the latest CycloneDX specification and offers compatibility with various BoM formats and specification versions through the CycloneDX CLI. Key features include options for verbose output, specifying project paths, output file paths, BoM version, and component metadata. It also handles CocoaPod subspecs effectively, ensuring each subspec required by the Podfile is included in the BOM. The tool is licensed under Apache 2.0 license.
