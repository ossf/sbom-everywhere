**[BOM](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/bom)**, a project under Kubernetes SIGs, is a versatile utility designed to create, view, and transform Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). It specifically addresses the need for generating SBOMs in the Kubernetes project, offering an efficient and powerful solution for software authors.

Key features of `bom` include:
- Generation of SPDX-compliant packages from various sources such as directories, container images, single files, etc.
- Built-in license classifier recognizing over 400 licenses from the SPDX catalog.
- Support for Golang dependency analysis.
- Full `.gitignore` support during git repository scans.

To install `bom`, the command `go install sigs.k8s.io/bom/cmd/bom@latest` is used. 

The `bom generate` subcommand is pivotal in creating SBOMs from files, images, and docker archives, with capabilities like pulling images from remote registries and analyzing them with a suite of analyzers. It also allows exporting SBOM data to an in-toto provenance attestation. The `bom document` subcommand, on the other hand, focuses on visualizing and querying SBOMs.

`bom` can handle different sources to generate an SPDX Bill of Materials, including processing directories, container images, and individual files. This flexibility and its integration with SPDX standards make `bom` a comprehensive tool for SBOM generation in various software development contexts.
