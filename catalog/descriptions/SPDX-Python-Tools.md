The [SPDX tools-python](https://github.com/spdx/tools-python) repository provides a Python library designed for parsing, validating, and creating Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) documents. It supports various formats like JSON, YAML, XML, RDF, and Tag/Value. The library also offers experimental support for the upcoming SPDX 3.0 specification, which includes creating and converting documents and serializing them to JSON-LD. It is useful for developers working with SPDX documents to ensure compliance and standardization in software bill of materials (SBOMs).
