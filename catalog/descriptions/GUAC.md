[Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition](https://guac.sh) (GUAC)  provides supply chain observability with a graph view of the software supply chain and tools for performing queries to gain actionable insights.

GUAC is for developers, operations, and security practitioners who need to identify and address problems in their software supply chain, including proactively managing dependencies and responding to vulnerabilities.

GUAC has three key differentiating features from other tools in this space

* **Works on more than one SBOM at a time.**
This allows observability into the entire software portfolio instead of application-by-application.
* **Aggregates additional data beyond the SBOM.**
GUAC brings in data like dependencies and vulnerabilities from trusted third-party sources, enriching the supply chain graph.
* **Provides APIs and a visualization tool.**
GUACâ€™s query and visualization tooling let the user get the answers to the questions they need to ask.
