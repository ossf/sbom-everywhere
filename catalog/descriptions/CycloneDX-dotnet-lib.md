The CycloneDX libraries for .NET enable developers to generate and consume
CycloneDX Bill-of-Materials (BOM) programmatically. CycloneDX is a lightweight,
human-readable BOM specification that is easy to create and parse. These libraries
support .NET Standard 2.0 and include an interop library for converting between
SPDX and CycloneDX formats (currently only supporting SPDX v2.2 JSON format).
For more information on getting started and detailed features, refer to the [documentation](https://cyclonedx.github.io/cyclonedx-dotnet-library/).
Additionally, pull requests are welcome for those who would like to contribute
to minimizing data loss during conversion.
