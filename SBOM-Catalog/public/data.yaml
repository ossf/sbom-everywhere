  Summary: |
    Hermeto is a CLI tool that pre-fetches your project's dependencies to aid in making your build process hermetic.

    The primary intended use of Hermeto's outputs is for network-isolated container builds.

    To play nicely with Hermeto, the build process for your project must be

    - **Defined** - Hermeto only fetches dependencies that are explicitly declared - typically in a lockfile generated by your package manager.
    - **Reproducible** - Hermeto will refuse to fetch a dependency if it's not pinned to an exact version. This goes for transitive dependencies as well (and ties to the Defined point). Most package managers pin all dependencies automatically in lockfiles.
    - **Secure** - Even with a lockfile, your build is not truly safe from supply chain attacks unless you verify the checksums of all dependencies. If your package manager supports specifying the expected checksums, we strongly encourage you to make use of them.

    In return, Hermeto will help make your build

    - **Auditable** - by generating a manifest of all the dependencies that go into your build.

    The ability to achieve the goals depends on the build process being hermetic. Ideally, you should try to isolate the build from both the internet and the underlying host system to avoid implicit dependencies, unreproducible behavior and whole hosts of other issues. Hermeto itself is not a hermetic build system. We suggest you take advantage of existing technologies - such as containers - to achieve network isolation.

    dependencies, vulnerabilities, and licenses.


    Key Features:

    - Browser-based processing without data transmission

    - Standalone CLI operation

    - Visual dependency mapping

    - Component relationship visualization

    - Vulnerability and license tracking

    - Interactive HTML output


    The tool can be deployed as a web application through GitHub Pages or local hosting,
    or utilized as a command-line interface tool. The generated reports provide comprehensive
    visibility into software composition and supply chain relationships documented
    in CycloneDX SBOMs.


    Developed by the CycloneDX community, Sunshine serves as an analytical tool for
    SBOM data interpretation and supply chain transparency.'
